## Usage

The package provides a Decoder with a single Decode method that returns a Gedcom struct. Use the NewDecoder method to create a new decoder.

This example shows how to parse a GEDCOM file and list all the individuals. In this example the entire input file is read into memory, but the decoder is streaming so it should be able to deal with very large files: just pass an appropriate Reader.


	package main

	import (
		"bytes"
		"github.com/iand/gedcom"
		"io/ioutil"
	)

    func main() {
		data, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("testdata/kennedy.ged")

		d := gedcom.NewDecoder(bytes.NewReader(data))

		g, _ := d.Decode()

		for _, rec := range g.Individual {
			if len(rec.Name) > 0 {
				println(rec.Name[0].Name)
			}			
		}
	}

The structures produced by the Decoder are in [types.go](types.go) and correspond roughly 1:1 to the structures in the [GEDCOM specification](http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm).

This package does not implement the entire GEDCOM specification, I'm still working on it. It's about 80% complete which is enough for about 99% of GEDCOM files. It has not been extensively tested with non-ASCII character sets nor with pathological cases such as the [GEDCOM 5.5 Torture Test Files](http://www.geditcom.com/gedcom.html).
